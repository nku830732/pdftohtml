PDF to HTML Converter Code Explanation
1. Structure and Layout (head and style)

The <head> section defines the metadata of the HTML document and includes the <style> section for CSS.

- CSS styles are defined in the <style> tag to control the appearance of the page.
- The body is centered vertically and horizontally using Flexbox to create a clean, centered layout.
- The .container class styles the main content box, giving it padding, a white background, and a shadow for emphasis.
- The file input, button, and output area are styled for simplicity.

2. Body Structure (body)

Container Div: The main section of the page contains the following:

- API Key Input: A password input field for entering the OpenAI API key. The button beside it saves the key when clicked.
- PDF Upload Input: An input field for uploading the PDF file (<input type="file">).
- Convert Button: A button (Convert to HTML) that triggers the file conversion process using the OpenAI API.
- Output Area: A <pre> element that displays the converted HTML after it is processed.

3. JavaScript Code

The JavaScript code is responsible for handling the core functionality of the webpage, including the API key handling, file reading, and OpenAI API interaction.

- API Key Handling: Allows users to input and save their OpenAI API key in a variable. If the user forgets to enter the API key or attempts to convert a PDF without saving it, the page prompts them with an alert.
- PDF Upload and Conversion: When the Convert to HTML button is clicked, the script checks if the API key and PDF file are provided. It reads the PDF file using FileReader API and sends the content to OpenAI API for conversion.

Key Concepts

- FileReader API: Reads the uploaded PDF file as binary data for further processing.
- OpenAI API: Sends a request to OpenAI API to convert the PDF content into HTML.
- fetch API: JavaScript's fetch() method is used to make an HTTP request to OpenAI API to process the PDF data.

Summary

This web application allows users to upload a PDF, input their OpenAI API key, and convert the PDF content into HTML. The functionality is handled through HTML, CSS for layout, and JavaScript for file handling and API interaction.
